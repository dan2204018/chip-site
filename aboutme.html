	<h2>My story</h2>
	<p>In the scorching summer of 2023, a small pug named Chip was found wandering the streets of Phoenix, looking lost and a bit weary.</p> 
	<p>His wrinkled face told a story of resilience, and despite the heat, there was a spark in his eyes that hinted at the joy he still carried within. Thankfully, kind-hearted souls took Chip to the Arizona Humane Society, providing him with shelter, food, and a cool place to rest.</p>
    <p>Chip quickly stole the hearts of everyone there, but it was a childhood friend of mine who first saw his true potential. She adopted him, hoping he would thrive in a family environment. However, despite their best efforts, it became clear that Chip didn’t fit in with the bustling energy of young children.</p> 
    <p>Recognizing his need for a quieter home filled with love, my friend reached out to me and my husband, knowing we were searching for a furry companion to share our lives with. When Chip arrived, it was as if a little piece of the universe had fallen into place.</p>
	<p>He immediately made himself at home, snuggling into our hearts and couch cushions with his adorable snorts and playful spirit. Our days now revolve around his antics—those silly zoomies around the living room and his hilarious obsession with chasing after his toys.</p>
	<p>We can’t imagine our lives without him. Chip is not just a dog; he’s a lively, loving member of our family, and we cherish every moment we spend together.</p>
